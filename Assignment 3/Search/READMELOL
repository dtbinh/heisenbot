STRUCTURAL NOTES:


Ok, the State is specific to the problem, e.g an eightPuzzle object is a state in the eightpuzzle problem.
The reason this works is because GENERICS.

Node.java - contains the current state object and the action made to get there
stackAgenda.java - contains some kind of list (stack list) of nodes to be explored. Depth First Search
queueAgenda - contains some kind of Queue list of nodes to be explored. Breadth First Search

IF WE CAN GET THESE THREE WOKRING. THEN WE CAN WRITE A BFS.java and a DFS.java and potentially even an AStar.java
depending on time

lets focus on this framework.
